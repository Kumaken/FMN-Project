------ABOUT------
Forget Me Not is a simple game that is NOT FUN and designed for PRIVATE USE only. Its gameplay only revolves around looking at photos and awkwardly guessing their nicknames. It has a plot, but not yet and probably would never be implemented ingame. Who would want even want to read such a suckish story penned by such an untalented amateur writer anyway? To make this game more bearable, the creator decided to add some style into the game.

------ FEATURES ------
1. Randomized Question to make your life harder.
2. Complicated ingame variables to make the creator look smarter than he actually is.
3. Cool chill music discovery that you sought for since at your mom's womb.
4. Cool stylish UI ripped from P5 spritesheet.
5. Testing your memorization ability and get you more acquainted with your UNIX peers.
6. Suckish plot written by incompetent hooman.
7. The realization that even with all these features, this game ain't fun.

------ INSTALLATION ------
You don't to install lol. Just download the HTML and open it. It'll link you to the game's page on scratch. The reason I don't upload my source file is because it exceeded 25mb GitHub file limit. Idk, maybe there's a workaround or something, but I'm a GitHub noob ok?

------ GAME MECHANICS & HOW TO PLAY -------
1. Stare into the faces.
2. Guess their nicknames. (WITH CAPITAL LETTERS)
3. Don't mess up.
    MDS(Memory Dive Simulation) is particularly straining for
    the data's well being, thus can only be sustained in a limited 
    period of time. Too much stress will corrupt the data.
    - if STRESS get to 100%, GAME OVER.
    - if TIME (middle-top) gets to 0, GAME OVER.
    - CALM (normal countdown), PANIC & DESPAIR (faster time 
      countdown)
    - You accumulate more SCORE pts and TIME bonus if you get it 
       correct consecutively (Streaks).
4. ???
5. You either ran out of time or got stressed out.
6. Screenshot your Score pts. You have now earned the bragging rights.

------PLOT------- (WARNING, IT SUCKS)

   You play as a renowned genius professor in researching human consciousness. Unfortunately you are somehow killed in a huge incident resulting not only your death but everyone inside your isolated research facility. 200 years later, somebody else has finally managed to do what you couldn't, to preserve lives as digital data, able to be stored and transferred by digital means, allowing people to live forever.

   However, death comes once again in form of AIDA (Artificially Intelligent Data Anomaly), an impossibly virulent and resilient virus,  corrupting and erasing consciousness from every human data it touches. Two unknown scientists managed to recover a fragment of your consciousness from your brain, preserved through cryogenic stasis. They suspect the AIDA outbreak stemmed from the incident 200 years ago. Now they dive into your memory data and demand you to recall all your remaining knowledge of your test subjects, hoping to unravel the truth about the AIDA and the incident. Was AIDA truly artificial? Or was it alive, a work of human possessing technology far too advanced for their time?

------ NOTES ------
